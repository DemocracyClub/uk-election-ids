UK Election IDs
===============

Create and validate Democracy Club Election Identifiers.

Democracy Club defines a specification for creating reproducible unique
identifiers for elections in the UK. See our `reference
definition <https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/reference_definition>`__.
If you are interested in independently producing identifiers which are
compatible with those produced by our `Every
Election <https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/>`__ platform, this
python package includes a builder object, slugging logic and validation
rules for creating identifiers that conform to the spec.
